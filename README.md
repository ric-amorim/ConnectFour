# Connect Four Game against AI
    
   (This project was made for the artificial intelligence curricular unit)
    
## About the project
   Adversarial games are games with two players who face each other with the objective of winning/losing their opponent. Examples of adversarial include chess, checkers, Go, among others. The solution of this type of games is a widely explored field in artificial intelligence and includes a high number of different amount of different algorithms. As such, in this project we implement three of these algorithms: Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) applied to the game Connect Four.
    

## How to Run
   1- compile the files (javac *.java)
   2- use $ java <strategy>

    strategy :
        minmax
        alphabeta
        MCTS

The libraries used were all from java.util
